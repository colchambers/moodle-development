			<h2>Welcome to the development centre for The Open University 'Offline Moodle' Project</h2>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>

			<p>The development centre is provided as a central point of reference for those involved in developing the Offline Moodle system for The Open University. We provide a number of documents and demonstrations during any development effort and the development centre is the area where we make these available to our clients so that they can become fully involved in each project. As the project progresses these documents will be updated and it is important to keep abreast of the latest ideas and agreements that have been made. </p>
			
			<h3>Navigating the Centre</h3>
			<p>Below there are links to the sections on this page. These links are also available on the menu to the right of this page. Links to each <a href="#whatIsASnapshot" title="What is a 'Snapshot'?">snapshot</a> that has been produced to date are also available on the right hand menu. </p>

			<h3>Our Development Process</h3>
			<p>We are often asked about the process we underatke in managing projects. To answer we have created a <a href="resources/documents/Process Description.html" >visual diagram</a> indicating the steps we take and the decision processes we go through. The process begins with establishing the project deliverables and ends with upload and signoff. As you will see there are a lot of steps in between. You will find that our <a href="#whatIsASnapshot" title="What is a 'Snapshot'?">snapshots</a> provide more detail about these steps. </p>
			<p>View the diagram in the following formats: <a href="resources/documents/Process Description.html" >html</a> <a href="resources/documents/Process Description.gif" >gif</a> <a href="resources/documents/Process Description.png" >png</a></p>

			<h3>What is a 'Snapshot'?</h3>
			<p>We use snapshots to demonstrate to our clients the systems we have agreed to develop. Where appropriate we aim to provide a snapshot which best demonstrates the application or solution that we intend to create. You the client then have the right to review and test this snapshot as best you see fit to ensure that it meets your requirements and will provide benefit and value to your organisation. 
			
			</p>
			<p>Snapshots are rarely full working versions of a solution. They represent our intentions at a given point in time. As such they are a crucial part of the development process and help to determine the clients expectations and requirements in a through way and make it clear to all involved what <strong>will or will not be required</strong> from the final solution. The dynamic nature of the development phase means that the snapshot can go through several revisions before being finally approved as a final version, and even then changes may occur late on at the clients or our request. </p>
			<p>The menu to the right lists all snapshots that have been issued to The Open University as a record of how the latest version has been arrived at. Therefore it can be useful to check this page at regular intervals to see if a new snapshot has been supplied.</p>

			<a name="whatDoesASnapshotContain"> </a>
			<h3>What does a snapshot contain?</h3>
			<p>Each snapshot is intended to explain and demonstrate our intentions for the proposed solution and will also build on the previous version. to make the snapshot easier to understand we always include the following options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Giving a general explanation of the snapshot and links to relevant sections of explanation and demonstration.</li>
				<li><strong>Section Explanations:</strong> New sections or sites may be included or updated from previous version. These changes are explained and links to them are provided.</li>
			</ul>

			Depending on the project requirements and stage of development there may be further information or documents provided, including:
<ul>
	<li><strong>PDP Document:</strong> Used in conjunction with the snapshot the Project Definition and Plan (PDP) document attempts to pin down specific details of the project. As such this document may be revised regularly as the project specifics are negotiated.</li>
			</ul>
