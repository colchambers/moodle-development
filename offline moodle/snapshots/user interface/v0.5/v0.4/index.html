			<h1>Version 0.4: Introduction</h1>
            <p>Web development is a process of turning the clients requests into
              reality. There is considerable room for interpretation of customer
              requirements and therefore we aim to provide our clients methods
              whereby they can sample our interpretation and interact with it
              as much as possible. </p>
            <p>This demonstration package has been provided as an example of phase
              one of the Offline Moodle System we aim to provide. The pages within the
              demonstration package have been designed with sufficient functionality
              to provide a demonstration of key deliverables and to serve as a
              clear example of what has been agreed. You will therefore find that
              some functionality such as menus and links do not work as expected
              or at all. You may also find that lists of documents commonly link
              to the same document to ease administration of the demonstration.
              If you would like to discuss the functionality that will be provided
              in the final version then please contact us.</p>
			 Phase one of the Offline Moodle System consists of one main section:
				<ul>
					<li>Offline Moodle: Client Synchronisation Interface</li>
				</ul>
				A demonstration of only the synchronisation interface has been included in this release. As well as providing a demonstration of the interface, we have provided short explanations of some of the key features. You can access these explanations directly using the links below. Alternatively
              access to all content can be achieved through the menus on the right
              hand side of this page. The links will open up in this browser window.

			<h2>Updates In this Version</h2>
			<p>The previous snaphost v0.3 introduced some significant improvement. This release focuses on smaller changes that either could not be incorporated into v0.3 or have been requested in user feedback. The following updates have been introduced:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Inactive links made obvious</strong>: Inactive links are links that will work in the live version but don't in the snapshot. They are now greyed out and the cursor changes to indicate they won't work.</li>
				<li>The synchronisation process was refined and extended significantly. Including:

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Navigation tree redesign</strong>: Centring around work to reduce the reliance on javascript and increase the use of standard, more accessible code.</li>
						<li><strong>Subtle improvements on a good foundation</strong>: The original concept is proving sound. The method of implementation is thus being tweaked. This release is consolidating the previous work instead of introducing more interactivity and features. That will occur in a later release.</li>
						<li><strong>Improved accessibility</strong>: To ensure the interface can be used on as many devices as possible and by as many people as possible.</li>
						<li><strong>More icons</strong>: These indicate the item type eg course, forum, wiki icons indicate the icons used. </li>
						<li><strong>All items can synchronise</strong>: The synchronise option is available for all items except if that item has been synchronised. </li>
						<li><strong>Improved general feedback</strong>:. e.g When items are empty they are shown as empty and the option to synchronise is removed</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
