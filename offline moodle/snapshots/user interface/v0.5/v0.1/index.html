			<h1>Version 0.1: Introduction</h1>
            <p>Web development is a process of turning the clients requests into 
              reality. There is considerable room for interpretation of customer 
              requirements and therefore we aim to provide our clients methods 
              whereby they can sample our interpretation and interact with it 
              as much as possible. </p>
            <p>This demonstration package has been provided as an example of phase 
              one of the Offline Moodle System we aim to provide. The pages within the 
              demonstration package have been designed with sufficient functionality 
              to provide a demonstration of key deliverables and to serve as a 
              clear example of what has been agreed. You will therefore find that 
              some functionality such as menus and links do not work as expected 
              or at all. You may also find that lists of documents commonly link 
              to the same document to ease administration of the demonstration. 
              If you would like to discuss the functionality that will be provided 
              in the final version then please contact us.</p>
			 Phase one of the Offline Moodle System consists of one main section: 
				<ul>
					<li>Offline Moodle: Client Synchronisation Interface</li>
				</ul>
				A demonstration of only the back end interface has been included in this release. As well as providing a demonstration of the interface, we have provided short explanations of some of the key features. You can access these explanations directly using the links below. Alternatively 
              access to all content can be achieved through the menus on the right 
              hand side of this page. The links will open up in this browser window.

			<h2>Supporting Documents for Offline Moodle</h2>
			<p>We have also provided a set of supporting documents to help define and manage the project. these documents are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="resources/documents/Moodle Offline Project.V1.1.doc" title="Project Specification">Project Specification</a></li>
					<li><a href="resources/documents/Synchronisation Process Flow.gif" title="Process Flow">Process Flow</a></li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Project Specification</h3>
			<p>This document contains definitions for all key aspects of the project. In combination with this snapshot it will be used at the final review meeting as a guideline to determine if we have met the requirements set out by The Open University and to ultimately sign the project off. The specification, like the snapshot, is expected to change over time as the project develops or if requirements change. Once all parties agree on the content of the specification a copy must be agreed by a member of each party to form a binding agreement.</p>
			
			<a name="supportingDocumentsProcessFlow"></a>
			<h3>Process Flow</h3>
			<p>To help everyone visualise how the various aspects of this feature will be linked we have created a diagram indicating the general flow through the site. This identifies how each part of the process is reached. We have created a <a href="resources/documents/Synchronisation Process Flow.htm" >visual diagram</a> that you can will find useful in helping you understand how the pages provided in this snapshot relate to each other.</p>
			<p>View the diagram in the following formats: <a href="resources/documents/Synchronisation Process Flow.htm" >html</a> <a href="resources/documents/Synchronisation Process Flow.gif" >gif</a> <a href="resources/documents/Synchronisation Process Flow.png" >png</a></p></a>
